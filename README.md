The proposed system is a web-based project that allows you to do everything a bank would allow you to do naturally. One should be able to deposit money and withdraw money from a particular account as the user desires.

There is validation to allow only a particular amount of cash inflows at any time, as well as to allow withdrawals if the balance is sufficient. There is also the calculation of interest and its addition to the balance every month.
